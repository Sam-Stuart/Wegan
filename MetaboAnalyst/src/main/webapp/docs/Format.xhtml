                    </p>
                    <p>
                        GC/LC-MS spectra must be in either <U>NetCDF</U>, <U>mzXML</U>, or <U>mzDATA</U> format. The spectra

                        The peak list data is composed of peak list files organized into separate folders named by their class labels.  
                        For example, if your data contains three groups, the peak list files should be organized into three folders accordingly.
                        Compress these folders into a single zip file then upload them to MetaboAnalyst.

                    <p>
                        NMR peak list files should contain two comma separated columns with the 1st column for peak 
                        positions (ppm) and the 2nd column for peak intensities; MS peak list files can be in either two-column (mass and intensities) 
                        or three-column format (mass, retention time and intensities), but not a mixture of both. The first line of each peak list file is reserved for 
                        column labels. The file must be saved in comma separated values (.csv) format.

                        For paired comparison, there must be an even (2n) number of samples. 
                        The class labels are required to be the numeric integers between -1 and -n/2 
                        and between 1 and n/2. Samples with class labels of the same absolute values are considered to be pairs. 
                        In the example below, <i>Patient1_d0</i> and <i>Patient1_d3</i> are a pair.

                        The screenshot illustrates the appropriate structure of a time-series data table.
                        In this example, there are three time points (the second column) 
                        and two experimental conditions (the third column). The data shown contains 
                        12 samples measured at three time points from 4 subjects. 
                        Two subjects are wild type (WT). The other two subjects are mutant type (MT). 

                        There are two special requirements for time series data:

                                Subjects are under the same experimental conditions during the time series. Namely, 
                                the time series should be either "control time-series" or "treatment time-series".

                                For instance, samples S1WT1, S1T2, S1T3 are samples

                        NMR peak list files should contain two comma separated columns with the 1st column for peak 
                        positions (ppm) and the 2nd column for peak intensities; MS peak list files can be in either two-column (mass and intensities) 
                        or three-column format (mass, retention time and intensities), but not a mixture of both. The first line of each peak list file is reserved for 
                        column labels. The file must be saved in comma separated values (.csv) format.

                        The paired sample information is encoded by using both sample names (<i>without suffix</i>) separated by a colon "<b>:</b>"
                        with one pair per line, and uploaded as a text file (.txt). The screen shot below illustrates the data 
                        structure for peak list data as well as the specifications of paired samples:

                    <p>
                        You can create biomarker models to predict new samples (with unknown class) using the 
                        <b>ROC Tester</b>. To do this, you need to upload a data that contains both the samples with class labels  
                        and the samples whose class label need to be predicted (<b>leave their sample labels empty</b>). A screenshot is shown below.

                        Before uploading your data to the module, please make sure that the names of your features (compound names, spectral bins, peaks) 
                        are consistent between the individual studies. At least 25% of the features must match between the studies. Also make sure that 
                        the group labels are also consistent between the studies, i.e. Cancer and Healthy. Finally, all uploaded sample identifiers must 
                        be unique.

                        Upload your data in either a tab-deliminted (.txt) format. 
                        Make sure that the uploaded table contains three columns with these exact names: m.z, p.value, and t.score.
                        Each feature should be in a row.

                        If p-values have not yet been calculated for their data, users can use the exploratory statistical analysis module
                        to upload their raw peak tables, process the data, perform t-tests or fold-change analysis, and then upload these 
                        results into the module. An example dataset is shown below:

                        It is critical for your data to be properly labeled so they can be uploaded into the Joint Pathway Analysis or Network Explorer module. 
                        The following common metabolite and gene IDs are supported:

                                Metabolite list: Common compound names, HMDB IDs, or KEGG compound IDs as metabolite identifiers.
