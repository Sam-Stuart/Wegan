            The networks constructed from user input (seed proteins) are usually composed of a giant 
            component (large "continent") together with several small "islands". These are listed as <b>subnetworks</b> in the 
            Network Explorer table, together with their total number of nodes, edges and the number of seed proteins 
            in each subnetwork as given as <b>queries</b>. Select (using checkbox or by clicking on a row)
