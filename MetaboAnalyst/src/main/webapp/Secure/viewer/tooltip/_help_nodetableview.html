                The table shows detailed properties of all nodes in the current network. 
                <b>Double clicking</b> on each column header to sort the table accordingly.
                The <b>Expr.</b> column shows the logFC values of the seed protein. When multiple 
                datasets are uploaded (meta-analysis), the value is the number of times a given 
                protein appears as significant in the individual data. A "-" indicates the corresponding 
                node is not a seed protein.
